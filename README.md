# MallCustomerSegmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior and characteristics in a mall setting. By analyzing customer data, we aim to uncover distinct customer segments which can help in targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which includes the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.


## Analysis and Segmentation
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing data distributions using various plots to identify patterns.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Using clustering algorithms like K-Means to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score.

## Results
The analysis reveals several distinct customer segments, providing insights into different types of customers frequenting the mall.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
